Write in response to: "The public cloud is ideal for data processing"

data processing is:
- Processing ability (compute and manipulate data)
- Storiage ability (ability to store data)
- Transfer ability (ability to import/export data to/from other systems)

Focus on big data processing?

Features or services examples
- S3 is a service
- Availability zone is a featire

Need to explain *why* a service or feature is important for processing

audience: uni students who have not studied cloud computing
- intelligent and understands basic computing, but wants a quick rundown to tell them why

More of an elevator pitch about data processing
What's good and why you should use cloud comptuing to help out
But what's not so good
